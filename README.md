# Term Deposit Subscription Prediction

## Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. The model is trained on a dataset containing customer attributes such as age, job type, marital status, education level, and more. We use a Random Forest Classifier, perform 5-fold cross-validation, and analyze feature importance to understand the key factors influencing a customer's decision.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Numpy

You can install these packages using pip:
```
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: The data is preprocessed to encode categorical variables and standardize numeric features.
2. **Model Training**: A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the preprocessed data.
3. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation and tested on a separate test set.
4. **Feature Importance Analysis**: The importance of each feature in the prediction is determined.

## Code Description

The code is structured as follows:
- Data is loaded and preprocessed, including encoding and standardization.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
- A Random Forest Classifier is initialized and trained.
- 5-fold cross-validation is performed to evaluate the model.
- The model is tested on a separate test set to verify its performance.
- Feature importance is extracted to understand the most influential factors.
